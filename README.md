# Cartoon Cartoon Summer Resort

Cartoon Cartoon Summer Resort is an open-world exploring game divided into four "episodes" in which you control a character (all four first appeared in failed pilot cartoons) and complete various tasks for different characters from Cartoon Network.
Completing tasks will earn you items which are used to give to other characters to complete the episode.  

The series of games was developed by [Funny Garbage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/funny-garbage/) for Cartoon Network in the very early 2000s.
The games were made to run on the web via the Shockwave platform and were developed in Macromedia Director 7.
The early 2000s saw the decline in the usage of Director/Shockwave as most developers preferred using Flash. This technology was later bought by Adobe. After many years, in 2019 Adobe announced that Adobe Shockwave, including the Shockwave Player, would be discontinued.

With the death of Shockwave, this game inevitebly died with it. It is still possible however to play the original game (and other Shockwave/Flash games) using software such as [Flashpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueMaxima's_Flashpoint).

## Why port this game?

You may be wondering why anyone would go through the effort to port this game to the modern web when it can still be played using Flashpoint. Well, there are many reasons as to why I think this game deserves a port:

* **It was designed to run in a web browser**
  * Flashpoint requires the user to install a program and sacrifice gigabytes of disk space to play a simple game. This is better than not being able to play it at all, but the original intention was for the user to open the browser and immediately start playing and having fun.
* **It is technically simple**
  * The original game's engine, source code, graphics, and gameplay are all straightforward and relatively simple to recreate. It is simple enough for one person to port it, so why not?
* **There is a lot of room for improvement**
  * The original game is littered with bugs, glitches, softlocks, and small oversights. There are also many quality of life features which can be added, such as individual sound settings, higher resolutions, framerates, and additional camera/panning settings just to name a few things.
* **It is nostalgic**
  * For me, (as with many others) this game takes me back to a simpler time in life. I have returned to this game in nostalgia trips, and I have even [reverse engineered and fixed bugs](https://mattbruv.github.io/ccsr-bugfix/) in the original game. The people who hold fond memories of this game deserve to be able to play it again.
